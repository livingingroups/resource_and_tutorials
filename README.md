# Resources and Tutorials
*
Below is a compiled list of various resources and tutorials, both internal and external, for tools, programming tricks, and tutorials related to science reform, reproducibiluty, and open data science in the department.
We can break this into sub pages as it grows.
## Data Management
### Exiftool
### Hashing
### ReadMe files
### Best naming practices
## Version Control with Git
Git is a software for tracking changes in sets of plain text files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code. 
In research it is largely used for Code Collaboration and Version Control.
Git can be run in the terminal, but most researchers use a Git Interface GUI.:
1. [Atlassian terminal tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git) from the makers of Bitbucket)
2. [Software CArpentry Tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

### [Github](https://github.com/)
The most heavily used, and well known provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. You are on it now. Owned by Microsoft
### [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
Another commonly used, open source code version control site.
### Git GUI Clients
#### RStudio
RStudio has a great built in Git Interface. [Tutorial here](https://happygitwithr.com/).
#### (GitKraken)[https://www.gitkraken.com/]
As taught in the EoAS Workshop.
#### GitHub Desktop
#### [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)
Another GUI that works Seamlessly with SublmeText, a great open source mutli (programming) language text editor



## Programming Languages
### R
#### Intoduction to R Tutorials
#### Creating Packages in R
### Python
### STAN
STAN is the most commonly used Hamiltonian MCMC proabailistic sampling engine for Bayesian inference. It can be implented in R, Python, and C++.
For R users, there are several "convenience" wrappers that can fir simple hierarchical models (and more) in stan.
1. rethinking pacakage and Richard McElreaths accompanying textbook.
2. brms fits STAN models using lme4 syntax
3. there is another one the youths use
### C++
### Bash aka Linux Terminal

## Manuscript Preparation
### LaTeX
LaTeX is a plain text document preapartion editor that uses the TeX language. 
It typsets plain text files. It integrates with BibTeX, an open source citation manager service. 
LaTeX is great for complicated mausccripts (i.e. dissertations and books) and manuscripts with alot of mathematical notation. 
It can also be used to make slides for presenatations. 
TeX documents can also be versioned controlled on GitHub. 
Many journals also have LaTeX templates one may use for submission.
#### Overleaf
Here is a [Youtube Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dnK2knSu0Q&t=2s) and [sample document](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5c3c4116de500c6cd5652f2f) for collaborative document preparation using Overleaf. 
Overleaf also integrated with GitHub.
#### ShareLaTeX
This is a similar collaborative LaTeX document preparation. The University has a free Pro account.
### Markdown
### RMarkdown
#### Ciation Mangers
##### Zotero
##### BibDesk
##### JabRef
